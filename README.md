Phlexy
======

This project is a followup to [my post on fast lexing in PHP][lexing_blog_post]. It contains a few lexer implementations
(both stateless and stateful) and related performance tests.

Install
-------

To install with composer:

```sh
composer require nikic/phlexy
```

Usage
-----

Lexers are created from a lexer definition using a factory class.

For example, if you want to create a `preg_replace` based stateless CSV lexer, you can use the following code:

```php
<?php
require 'path/to/lib/Phlexy/bootstrap.php';

$factory = new Phlexy\LexerFactory\Stateless\UsingPregReplace(
    new Phlexy\LexerDataGenerator
);

$lexer = $factory->createLexer(array(
    '[^",\r\n]+'                     => 0, // 0, 1, 2, 3 are the tokens
    '"[^"\\\\]*(?:\\\\.[^"\\\\]*)*"' => 1, // they should really be constants
    ','                              => 2,
    '\r?\n'                          => 3,
));

$tokens = $lexer->lex("hallo world,foo bar,more foo,more bar,\"rare , escape\",some more,stuff\n...");
```

Similarly a stateful lexer:

```php
<?php
require 'path/to/lib/Phlexy/bootstrap.php';

$factory = new Phlexy\LexerFactory\Stateful\UsingCompiledRegex(
    new Phlexy\LexerDataGenerator
);

// The "i" is an additional modifier (all createLexer methods accept it)
$lexer = $factory->createLexer($lexerDefinition, 'i');
```

For an example of a stateful lexer definition, you can look the [definition for lexing PHP source
code][php_lexer_definition].

Performance
-----------

A performance comparison for the different lexer implementations can be done using the [performance testing
script][performance_test_file]:

    Timing alphabet lexing of random string:

    Took 0.42041087150574 seconds (Phlexy\Lexer\Stateless\WithCapturingGroups)

    Took 0.37058591842651 seconds (Phlexy\Lexer\Stateless\UsingPregReplace)

    Timing PHP lexing of this file:
    Took 0.098251104354858 seconds (Phlexy\Lexer\Stateful\Simple)
    Took 0.020735025405884 seconds (Phlexy\Lexer\Stateful\UsingCompiledRegex)

    Timing PHP lexing of larger TestAbstract file:
    Took 0.268701076507570 seconds (Phlexy\Lexer\Stateful\Simple)
    Took 0.065788984298706 seconds (Phlexy\Lexer\Stateful\UsingCompiledRegex)

`Stateless\Simple` and `Stateful\Simple` are trivial lexer implementations (which loop through the regular expressions).

`Stateless\WithoutCapturingGroups`, `Stateless\WithCapturingGroups` and `Stateful\UsingCompiledRegex` use the compiled
regex approach described in the blog post mentioned above.

`Stateless\UsingPregReplace` is an extension of the compiled regex approach, where the looping through the regular
expression is done by (mis)using `preg_replace_callback`.

As the above performance measurments show, the `Simple` approach is a good bit slower than using compiled regexes. For
the CVS data it's only 1.17 times faster, but the difference significantly increases the more regular expressions there
are. E.g. lexing of the alphabet on a random string is more than twice as fast. For lexing PHP the compiled approach
is five times as fast.

The `preg_replace` trick makes the whole thing another bit faster. Sadly `preg_replace` can't be used for stateful
lexers, at least I couldn't figure out a fast way to do the state transitions.
